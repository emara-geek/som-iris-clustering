# Iris dataset clustering using Self-Organizing Maps

In this repository, I attempt to build a self-organizing map that clusters iris flowers dataset into classes, such that similar classes are grouped together. 

Output when using 2X2 Grid with 10000 epochs,
```
Cluster 0 has number of instances 49, Setosa 49, Versicolor 0, Virginica 0

Cluster 1 has number of instances 51, Setosa 0, Versicolor 30, Virginica 21

Cluster 2 has number of instances 22, Setosa 1, Versicolor 19, Virginica 2

Cluster 3 has number of instances 28, Setosa 0, Versicolor 1, Virginica 27
```
